#Send pictures to a server using an IOT board display them on a webpage/phone app

This project is aimed at making the link between the IOT board and the cloud and fetching images from the cloud on a phone app or a webpage.

The project has a python code, a server code and webpage code for now. 
The webpage code can be built into an app using Apache Cordova.
The sever now supports cross origin resource sharing too!
