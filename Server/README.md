#Server
The servers written here are the very basic sketch on how you can use NodeJs with your IOT application.

## Usage

The codes I will be writing here are written in NodeJs,like I mentioned earlier, with express .
###Install NodeJs on your system
Follow this [link](https://nodejs.org/) to get started with NodeJs on your system.
It is relatively easy to install on a Mac and a Linux system :)

###Install NodeJs on Heroku
Follow this [link] (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) .
I use Heroku to test all my applications. If you have installed NodeJs on your system, it won't be hard for you to install it on Heroku at all!  It is easy to use and has good support. You could use another service of your choice for testing stuff.

## Questions?
But why write your own server when ThingSpeak and a bunch of really good services are already available?
>In your own product, you need control on everything that you will be working on.
>The servers can be tweeked to work whichever way you want.
>With a little bit experience you can scale it up
>It is always a better option to secure your data.
