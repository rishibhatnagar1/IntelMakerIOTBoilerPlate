#Server
The servers written here are the very basic sketch on how you can use NodeJs with your IOT application.

## Usage

The codes I will be writing here are written in NodeJs,like I mentioned earlier, with express .

But why write your own server when ThingSpeak and a bunch of really good services are already available?
>In your own product, you need control on everything that you will be working on.
>The servers can be tweeked to work whichever way you want.
>With a little bit experience you can scale it up
>It is always a better option to secure your data.
